Make sure you have ruby installed inbeforehand

To run the Program, execute the following command:
$ ruby -r "./cake_program.rb" -e "CakeProgram.new.run"

To run the Tests, execute the following command:
$ ruby -r "./tests/tests.rb" -e "Tests.new.run"
The tests take up to a minute.
If you want to cut that time by up to 30s, set the class constants for the cook in orders.rb 

I might have missed on commenting somewhere, so I would be glad to discuss that matter if you have any questions regarding this task.
